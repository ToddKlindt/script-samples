# Download all documents from all document libraries in a site, including version history

> [!Note]
> This is a submission helper template please find the [contributor guidance](/docfx/contribute.md) to help you write this scenario.

## Summary

This PowerShell function will download all documents from all document libraries in a site, including version history. The documents will be saved in a folder structure that matches the library structure. You will have to connect to the site first using Connect-PnPOnline before running this script.
Save the code to a PSM1 file, then import it into your PowerShell session using Import-Module like in Example01. You can then run the function Download-SharePointFiles to download the documents.

.SYNOPSIS
Downloads files from all SharePoint document libraries in a tenant to a local directory. Requires PnP PowerShell 2.x and and existing connection to the tenant with Connect-PnPOnline.

.DESCRIPTION
This script connects to a SharePoint tenant using PnP PowerShell, iterates through all document libraries, and downloads files to a specified local directory. It can optionally overwrite existing files and download all versions of the files.

.PARAMETER DownloadPath
Specifies the local directory where files will be saved.

.PARAMETER Overwrite
Indicates whether to overwrite existing files in the local directory.

.PARAMETER IncludeVersions
Specifies whether to download all versions of the files.

.EXAMPLE
Download files to a local directory:
Download-SharePointFiles -DownloadPath "C:\SharePointDownloads"

.EXAMPLE
Download files and overwrite existing ones:
Download-SharePointFiles -DownloadPath "C:\SharePointDownloads" -Overwrite

.EXAMPLE
Download files including all versions:
Download-SharePointFiles -DownloadPath "C:\SharePointDownloads" -IncludeVersions

.EXAMPLE
Download files, overwrite existing ones, and include all versions:
Download-SharePointFiles -DownloadPath "C:\SharePointDownloads" -Overwrite -IncludeVersions
